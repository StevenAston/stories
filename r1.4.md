# Is it possible when I'm exporting documents to export the generated images with a fallback to the native file if the images don't exist?

Excellent and very specific question. This is a classic e-discovery production scenario.

I have combed through the [*Import/Export Guide* dated July 11, 2025](https://help.relativity.com/PDFDownloads/R1_PDF/RelativityOne%20-%20Import%20Export%20Guide.pdf)

**Yes, this is absolutely possible.** The functionality you're describing is a standard workflow for exporting productions. The key is using a combination of settings on the **Image Source** dialog.

Here is the relevant information from the document and the step-by-step process:

### The Key Section in the Documentation

The settings you need are detailed in the export workflow steps, [specifically on **page 142**](https://help.relativity.com/PDFDownloads/R1_PDF/RelativityOne%20-%20Import%20Export%20Guide.pdf#page=142) under the section "On the Image Source dialog, select what images you want to export."

### How to Configure Your Export

To achieve your goal (export images, but if they don't exist, export the native), you need to configure your export job with the following logic:

1.  In the **Image Source** dialog (page 142), make sure your settings are as follows:
    *   **Production Images Type:** Select **Produced Images**.
    *   **Select Productions:** Move the production set(s) that contain your generated images from the "Available Productions" box to the "Selected Productions" box.
    *   **Include original images:** This is the crucial step. **Toggle this option ON.**

2.  On the next screen, the **File Settings** dialog (page 143), ensure that **Export Native Files** is also toggled ON.

### Why This Works

Here is the logic, based on the documentation:

*   By selecting **Produced Images**, you are telling Relativity that your first preference is to export the images from the production sets you specified.
*   By toggling on **Include original images**, you are creating a fallback condition. The document explains this setting is for "documents that haven't been produced" or are not found in the selected productions.
*   The system will process each document in your export scope and ask:
    *   "Does this document have a produced image in the selected production(s)?"
    *   If **YES**, it exports the produced image.
    *   If **NO**, the "Include original images" toggle instructs the system to then export the *original document* instead. Because you enabled "Export Native Files" in the next step, this results in the native file being exported for that document.

The note on the bottom of page 142 confirms this behavior:

> "If the document is not a part of any of the selected productions, and "Include original images" toggle is enabled, then the original document is produced."

In summary, the combination of selecting **Produced Images** and also enabling the **Include original images** toggle is exactly how you create that "image-first, native-as-fallback" export you're looking for.
