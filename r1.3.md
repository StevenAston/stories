### ðŸ¤” I've imported some PDFs with no 'native file'. Can I convert them directly to images?
---
This is a very common situation in e-discovery, and Relativity can handle it easily. Since you already have a PDF, that PDF **is** your file that can be imaged. You don't need the "original native" (like the .MSG file) to create a TIFF or JPG image for review.

Hereâ€™s how to think about it and the step-by-step process:

### The Core Concept

*   **Native File:** The original, editable file (e.g., `.xlsx`, `.docx`, `.msg`).
*   **Image File:** A static picture of the document (e.g., `.tiff`, `.jpg`, `.png`), typically created from the native file or, in your case, from a production PDF.

Your PDF is a "static" file, much like an image. The Relativity imaging engine (which uses Foxit or Adobe in the background) can directly convert any PDF into a TIFF image.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Since the PDFs are already imported, you just need to tell Relativity to image them.

#### Step 1: Isolate the PDFs in a Saved Search

You need to create a group of documents to image. Since you only want to image these specific PDFs, the best way is to find them.

1.  Go to the **Documents** tab.
2.  Create a new **Saved Search**.
3.  Add these conditions:
    *   **Condition 1:** `File Type` `is` `PDF`
    *   **Condition 2:** `Control Number` `is one of` (Then manually enter the control numbers of the specific PDF production files you want to image).
4.  **Save** this search with a clear name like "PDF Productions to Image".

#### Step 2: Create an Imaging Profile (If Needed)

An Imaging Profile tells Relativity *how* to create the images (e.g., color, B&W, resolution). Your instance likely already has a standard one (like "Standard B&W 300 DPI").

*   If you're not sure, check under the **Admin** tab or in the **Resources** tab for "Imaging Profiles".
*   If you need to create one, go to **Imaging Profiles** and click **New Imaging Profile**. A common setting for productions is:
    *   **Image Format:** `TIFF`
    *   **Color:** `Black and White`
    *   **Resolution:** `300 DPI`

#### Step 3: Create an Imaging Set

The Imaging Set is the "job" that links the documents you want to image with the profile that defines how to image them.

1.  Navigate to the **Imaging Sets** tab (often under the "Processing" section of the left-hand menu).
2.  Click **New Imaging Set**.
3.  Configure it:
    *   **Name:** "Image PDF Productions" or something descriptive.
    *   **Data Source:** Click **Choose Saved Search** and select the search you made in Step 1 ("PDF Productions to Image").
    *   **Imaging Profile:** Select the appropriate profile (e.g., "Standard B&W").
4.  Click **Save**.

#### Step 4: Run the Imaging Set

1.  From the **Imaging Sets** tab, find your new imaging set in the list.
2.  Click the **Run** button.
3.  A job will be submitted. You can monitor its progress in the **Jobs** tab.
4.  Once the job is complete, the images will be generated and attached to those document records.

### How to Verify It Worked

1.  Go back to your saved search ("PDF Productions to Image").
2.  Open one of the documents.
3.  In the viewer, you should now see an **Images** tab or option next to the Native and Text tabs. You can click on it to view the newly created TIFF images.

**Important Note:** Since the PDF is your only file, it will be listed as the "Native" file. The imaging process does not remove or replace the PDF; it simply adds a new set of TIFF image files to the same document record. Reviewers can choose to view the PDF native or the generated TIFF images.
