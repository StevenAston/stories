Of all the places to contemplate the nature of heroism, a modern gymnasium might be the least likely. It is a realm of Sisyphean repetition, of quiet grunts and the clanging of iron, a secular temple dedicated to the sculpting of the self. Yet, it is also a stage for a very specific kind of human theater. Observe the older Italian gentleman, still in remarkable shape, holding court in the changing room, his monologue arias on the virtues of his own physique. Or consider the triangle-shaped youth, his upper body a monument to the bench press and his legs an afterthought, dispensing bro-science with the unshakeable confidence of a prophet. They are archetypes, small-scale sovereigns of their own carefully constructed domains.

This modern peacocking, this quest for physical validation, can feel far removed from the grand, bloody tapestry of history. But occasionally, history produces a figure so utterly remarkable, so brimming with a life force that defies easy categorization, that he seems to have sprung fully-formed from a novelist's imagination. A man whose story is so packed with daring, style, and sheer grit that it makes the preening of gym-goers seem like a pale shadow of human potential. A man who truly, unequivocally, *rocked*.

His name was Eugene Bullard, and he might just be the coolest man who has ever lived.

### An Unlikely Escape

To understand the man, you must first understand the world he was desperate to escape. Eugene James Bullard was born on October 9th, 1895, in Columbus, Georgia, a time and place where the ink on the Emancipation Proclamation was barely dry and the shadow of the Confederacy loomed long and menacing. He was the seventh of ten children born to William Bullard, a man who had himself been born into slavery, and Josephine Thomas. His family life, by all accounts, was as stable and loving as one could hope for under the oppressive thumb of the Jim Crow South. His parents worked tirelessly to insulate their children from the baseline venom of a society built on segregation and racial hierarchy.

William, in particular, instilled in his son a core lesson: in the face of institutionalized racism and the daily threat of white violence, a Black man had to defend his dignity and self-respect at all costs. This was not an abstract principle; it was a survival guide. The lesson was driven home with terrifying clarity one day when William argued with his white boss over being systematically underpaid. The argument ended, but the threat followed him home in the form of an all-white lynch mob descending on the Bullard household.

The family survived the ordeal, but the terror of it settled deep into young Eugene’s psyche. At just eleven years old, he made a decision that would define the rest of his life: America was not for him. He ran away. It wasn’t his first attempt—a wanderlust and a sense that he was destined for greater things had always pulled at him—but this time, it was final. He would never see his family again.

The life of a lone, eleven-year-old Black child in rural Georgia at the turn of the 20th century was perilous. He encountered the predictable cast of monstrous characters: racists who treated him like dirt, thieves who tried to steal his meager possessions, and predators who literally attempted to re-enslave him. Yet, he was wiry, quick-witted, and a fighter. He kept getting away, pushing onward until, on the outskirts of Atlanta, his luck changed. He stumbled upon the Stanleys, a traveling family of English Roma people who, in a strange turn of fate, took him in.

What began as a child labor arrangement—Eugene was put to work mucking out stables—blossomed into a quasi-familial bond. He learned about horses, and after watching a race, the small-statured boy convinced the Stanleys to let him ride as their jockey in the county championship. He won. But more importantly, the Stanleys gave him a window into another world. They told him of Europe, and of an England where, they claimed, the kind of vicious, skin-deep racism that defined America simply didn’t exist. To an English Roma family, a group perpetually marginalized across Europe, America’s brand of racial animus was uniquely baffling and cruel. "You should go to England," they told him. "You'll be happier there."

When he asked to travel with them, they explained they wouldn't be returning for months. But they gave him a tip worthy of a seasoned adventurer: stow away. They pointed him toward a freighter in Norfolk, Virginia, bound for Hamburg, Germany, with a stopover in Aberdeen, Scotland. And so, the young teenager did exactly that. He snuck aboard a ship, crossed the Atlantic, disembarked in Scotland, and then hitchhiked and walked the entire length of Great Britain until he arrived, penniless and alone, in London.

### The Boxer and the Belle Époque

London was a whirlwind. With no formal education and few skills beyond manual labor and a newfound talent for horse racing, Bullard did what he always did: he adapted. He fell in with a troupe of Black American street performers, a child circus of sorts, where he worked as a slapstick comedian, a tumbler, and, in a classic piece of carnival cruelty, the target in a dunk tank. One can only hope he spent his time in the tank hurling expertly crafted insults at the British locals, honing a different kind of fighting skill.

It was in this vibrant, chaotic world that he met Aaron Lister Brown, better known as “The Dixie Kid.” Brown was a former welterweight boxing champion of the United States, a title he’d acquired in a manner so gloriously corrupt it deserves its own footnote in sporting history. In a 1904 match against the champion, Barbados Joe Walcott, a fading Brown was saved when the referee, one Duck Sullivan, abruptly disqualified Walcott for no discernible reason and awarded the championship to Brown. It was later discovered the good Mr. Sullivan had placed a hefty bet on the challenger. The title was overturned, but Brown never stopped calling himself a former champion.

By the time Bullard met him, Brown was a boxing promoter and trainer in London, scouting for tough-looking kids he could mold into fighters. Bullard, who had grown into a powerfully built young man, was a perfect candidate. He began fighting in the London circuit and proved to be a natural, winning all of his bouts by knockout. Brown saw greater potential and began organizing fights on the continent, particularly in Paris.

The moment Eugene Bullard set foot in Paris, he was home. He not only continued his undefeated streak in the ring, but he also fell deeply in love with France. Here, he discovered a society that, while not free of prejudice, lacked the suffocating, institutionalized racism he had known his entire life. He befriended Frenchmen, fellow American expatriates, Black and white, who treated him as an equal. The experience was transformative. "It seemed to me," he would later write, "that French democracy influenced the minds of both black and white Americans and helped us all to act like brothers."

He thrived. He learned French, became a local boxing celebrity, and reveled in a culture that was, for the first time, truly open to him. But this Parisian idyll, like so many others, was built on the fragile peace of the Belle Époque. And in the summer of 1914, the world exploded.

### The Black Swallow of Death

When Germany declared war on France, Bullard’s devotion to his adopted country was absolute. As a non-citizen, his only path to service was the legendary French Foreign Legion. He immediately enlisted. To show his dedication, he unofficially changed his middle name from James to the more Gallic "Jacques," a name he would use for years to come.

After training, Machine-Gunner Bullard was sent on a grand tour of what would soon become the most infamous killing fields in human history. He fought at the Somme and in the Second Battle of Champagne, where he was wounded for the first time. In a military where colonial troops were often treated as cannon fodder, Bullard fought in integrated units, shoulder-to-shoulder with men from all corners of the French empire and beyond. He was eventually transferred to the 170th Infantry Regiment, a unit nicknamed *Les Hirondelles de la Mort*—the Swallows of Death. It was here he earned his own moniker: the Black Swallow of Death.

The nickname was cemented at Verdun. While running a message across the churned, hellish landscape, an artillery shell exploded nearby. Shrapnel ripped through his body, severing his femoral artery. He should have bled to death in minutes, but a combination of severe dehydration and prompt first aid saved his life. The wound was grievous enough to take him off the front lines permanently. For his service and valor, the French military awarded him the Croix de Guerre.

But for a man like Eugene Bullard, being taken off the front line was not an end but a pivot. While recovering in the hospital, he made a bet with a friend for $2,000—an astronomical sum worth nearly $60,000 today—that he, a man with a fifth-grade education who was still learning to read and write fluently, could get into the French Air Service.

Planes were still a novelty, barely a decade old. Strapping a machine gun to one was an even newer, and frankly insane, idea. His friend, reasonably skeptical, took the bet. Bullard, ever the charmer, befriended a wounded Air Service officer in the hospital. Over cards and drinks, the officer promised to make an introduction. By October 1916, against all odds, it worked. Eugene Bullard began his training to become a pilot.

In May 1917, he earned his wings. "By midnight," he recalled of the celebration in Paris, "every American in Paris knew that an American Negro by the name of Eugene Bullard, born in Georgia, had obtained the first military pilot's license given to someone like him." He was not the world's first Black combat pilot—that honor likely belongs to an Ottoman aviator—but he was one of the first five, and he was definitively America's first.

He joined the Lafayette Flying Corps, a unit of American volunteers flying for France. He flew a SPAD S.VII, a biplane of wood and canvas renowned for being a relatively stable gun platform—the highest praise one could offer a glorified kite with a motor. On the side of his fuselage, he painted his personal insignia: a heart pierced by a dagger, with the slogan, "All Blood Runs Red." And, in a detail that elevates his story from merely heroic to the realm of legend, he flew every mission accompanied by his pet monkey, Jimmy.

Within months, Bullard claimed two aerial victories, though only one was officially confirmed by witnesses. His most famous engagement came in November 1917, when his squadron tangled with a group of elite German pilots. Bullard found himself in a frantic dogfight, his plane riddled with over a hundred bullets before he managed to turn the tables and shoot down his adversary. He crashed just inside friendly lines, miraculously uninjured, as was Jimmy the monkey.

Back at the airfield, his commander informed him just how lucky he’d been. The pilot he had dueled was a member of the "Flying Circus," the elite Jagdgeschwader 1, commanded by none other than Manfred von Richthofen—the Red Baron.

When the United States finally entered the war, Bullard rushed to join the U.S. Army Air Service. Despite his combat experience and proven skill, he was rejected. The reason was simple and brutal: the American military did not allow Black pilots. In fact, his very existence was an inconvenience. The NAACP would later discover that the U.S. government actively censored news reports from France about Bullard's exploits, fearing that the story of a Black flying ace might give African Americans back home dangerous ideas about equality.

Undeterred, Bullard returned to his French squadron, but his flying career soon came to an abrupt end. The exact reason remains murky. Bullard claimed it was due to an argument with a racist French officer, which an American liaison used as a pretext to have him removed. His comrades told a more direct story: Bullard didn't just argue with the officer; he punched him squarely in the face. Whatever the truth, he was grounded and spent the rest of the war in a non-combat role.

### The King of Montmartre and the Shadow of War

After the armistice, Bullard had no intention of returning to the United States. Under a rule called *Français par le sang versé* ("French by spilled blood"), his combat wounds granted him full French citizenship. He married a French woman, had two daughters, and opened a nightclub, *L'Escadrille*, in Paris. He also managed an athletic club, started a jazz band that toured the world, and, for good measure, resumed his boxing career while on tour, again going undefeated.

His nightclub became the toast of Paris, not least because Bullard's fame and connections secured him a license to stay open later than any other establishment in the city. It became a favorite haunt for the "Lost Generation." Langston Hughes, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, and Ernest Hemingway were all regulars and friends. Hemingway was so taken with Bullard that he based a character on him in his first novel, *The Sun Also Rises*. Eugene Bullard, the runaway from Georgia, had become a fabulously wealthy, universally beloved celebrity—a king in his adopted city.

But as the 1930s wore on, the festive lights of Paris began to dim under the rising shadow of Nazi Germany. Once again, France called upon its adopted son. The French intelligence service, the *Deuxième Bureau*, recruited Bullard as a spy. His mission: to listen in on the conversations of the German guests who frequented his club. He was perfect for the role. The Nazi sympathizers and agents, blinded by their own racist ideology, could never conceive that the affable Black nightclub owner understood German and was reporting their every word. He played the part of the deferential host, buttering them up with free drinks while they let slip crucial information, or simply lingered nearby, counting on their assumption that he was intellectually incapable of understanding their plots. Through his espionage, at least a dozen German spies were arrested.

When the Nazis invaded France in May 1940, Bullard, now in his mid-40s and battered by old war wounds, once again went to the nearest recruiting office. The French army, presumably shrugging and saying, "Sure, man, fuck it," put him back in the 51st Infantry Division as a machine gunner. He was wounded twice more before the country fell.

His friends and the Red Cross warned him that he had to flee. As a Black man, a famous American, a French war hero, and a known spy, he would be a prime target for the Gestapo. He wanted to stay and join the Resistance, but he was finally convinced to leave. Red Cross workers smuggled him through Spain to Portugal, where he boarded a ship and sailed back to the one place he never wanted to be: the United States.

### An Exile in His Own Land

His return was a brutal shock. He arrived in New York with nothing, having been forced to leave his fortune and property behind in France. He was no longer a celebrated war hero and cultural icon; he was just another unemployed Black man in a country that still saw him as a second-class citizen. He was a complete unknown. When America entered World War II, he tried to volunteer again, but refused the menial, segregated roles offered to Black soldiers. "I'm a goddamn war hero," he argued, to no avail. He worked odd jobs—a security guard, a longshoreman—to make ends meet.

The injustice radicalized him. He became involved in the burgeoning Civil Rights movement. In 1949, he attended a concert in Peekskill, New York, held by the singer and activist Paul Robeson. The event was attacked by a racist mob, including members of the American Legion and the VFW, whipped into a frenzy by false reports that Robeson had made anti-American statements in Paris. Bullard, ever the fighter, rushed to defend the concertgoers. The police arrived and, true to form, joined the side of the racists, beating Bullard severely. The assault was caught on camera and would later be featured in a documentary narrated by Sidney Poitier.

The experience solidified his alienation. He nearly beat a bus driver who demanded he move to the back of the bus. This was the final straw. He returned to Paris.

France welcomed him back as a hero. His club had been destroyed by the Nazis, but the French government gave him full restitution to rebuild, paid him years of back pay for his military pension and disability, and showered him with honors. President Charles de Gaulle invited him to be one of the three men to relight the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor, France's highest order of merit.

He eventually returned to New York to be near his daughters, who had moved to the U.S. for school. On October 12, 1961, Eugene Jacques Bullard died of stomach cancer. He was buried with full military honors in the French War Veterans' section of Flushing Cemetery in Queens.

For decades, the United States, the country of his birth, had given him nothing but rejection and contempt. It was not until 1994, thirty-three years after his death and seventy-seven years after they had first rejected him, that the U.S. Air Force posthumously commissioned him as a Second Lieutenant. It was a gesture of recognition, but it was profoundly late and tragically insufficient.

The life of Eugene Bullard is a story of relentless forward motion against the friction of a hateful world. He was a man who, told he was less than human, responded by becoming a champion, a hero, a spy, and a legend. He embodied the dignity his father had told him to defend, and he did it with a style and panache that remains breathtaking. His story is a testament to the limitless potential of a single human spirit, and a sorrowful indictment of a nation that, for too long, refused to see him for the giant he was. He was, in the end, too cool for the country that made him.
