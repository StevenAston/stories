# How Fragrantica Generates Fragrance Accords

## Question

Is there any info on how the accords are generated or added on the website Fragrantica?

## Answer

The accord system on Fragrantica uses a clever crowdsourced mechanism with editorial oversight. Here's how it works based on direct explanations from Fragrantica's administrator (zoka):

### The Core Mechanism

Each ingredient in Fragrantica's database has its own accords profile. Some ingredients like flowers or sweets might have just one single accord, while other ingredients have multiple accords assigned to them.[^1]

The editorial staff assigns each note a 0-100 value for various accords.[^2] For example, ambergris might have certain values for different accords, and administrators can see these weighted values in their backend system.[^2]

Once users vote on which ingredients are more prominent in a fragrance, those accords get more weight in the calculation.[^1]

### The Calculation Process

The system essentially performs a weighted sum: the accord values assigned to each note are multiplied by user vote weights for note prominence, then aggregated across the entire fragrance pyramid.[^2]

As zoka explains:

> "As you can see even if rose most probably has a lot of rose accords and floral but according to your votes weight of amber is strong so we have dominant amber accord. For some other compositions like flowery pyramids few flowers together may push to stronger let's say 'white flower' accord even if each ingredient on it's own is not very dominant."[^2]

For example, in Givenchy Organza, nutmeg is the most prominent ingredient with a strong "fresh spicy" accord, but when combined with multiple flowers, the calculation determines that the fragrance is white floral, woody, and fresh spicy.[^2]

### Dynamic Updates

The accords are recalculated in real-time. Every time a user votes for ingredients, new accords are immediately re-calculated and updated.[^2]

### Editorial Correction

Fragrantica's editors actively monitor and fine-tune the system. As zoka describes:

> "How we 'correct' those accords... well our editors who maintain database when they notice some perfume (known enough and voted enough) if some accord dominates and it is wrong, or some perfume should be for example powdery but it is not... then they look at ingredients is there mistake in pyramid or should they rebalance a bit some weight on ingredients and fine-tune our accords."[^3]

The editorial team investigates by:
1. Checking if there's a mistake in the fragrance pyramid (wrong ingredients listed)
2. Rebalancing the accord weights assigned to specific ingredients
3. Fine-tuning the overall accord calculations

### Initial State for New Fragrances

The main accords displayed on Fragrantica are generated by the site itself based on voted notes—they are not official information from the fragrance brands.[^1]

When a new fragrance is added with no user votes yet, the accords are derived purely from the listed notes. For these new releases without substantial voting, the main accords typically start out equal.[^1]

### Design Philosophy

The accord system was developed by Elena (jeca) and zoka as an improvement over traditional perfume classification systems.[^4]

As zoka explains:

> "We don't use classical 'chypre, fougere, oriental' accords in this classification. It doesn't say anything to many people. We use earthy, mossy, warm or fresh spicy."[^4]

For example, a fougère fragrance might be classified as herbal, floral, and fresh spicy, but could also be green, mossy, or earthy.[^4]

The system was designed to be more intuitive and accessible than traditional perfume classification schemes, which were developed long ago and don't adequately define modern fragrances with sweet, fruity, and savory notes.[^4]

### How It Works in Practice

The accord system represents what zoka calls "metadata work" — trying to make sense of the many user interactions and votes on the site.[^3] It's essentially a hidden matrix where:

- Each note has pre-assigned accord weights (0-100 for various accord types)
- User voting on note intensity drives the visible accord bars dynamically  
- The whole system is adjustable both at the individual ingredient level and through editorial intervention when the math produces unexpected results

It's a sophisticated crowdsourced system that balances algorithmic calculation with human editorial judgment to produce the accord profiles users see on each fragrance page.
