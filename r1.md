# Troubleshooting RelativityOne Export Errors

### 0. Job Details Page (User-Accessible Log)

**To Access:**

1.  Navigate to the **Jobs** tab in your Relativity workspace. You can usually find this in the top navigation bar.
2.  Find your export job in the list. You can sort by "Time Submitted" or look for the job name you gave it.
3.  Click on the **Name** of the job to open its details page.

**What to look for on the Job Details page:**

*   **Status:** This might say "Completed" (which is confusing for 0 files) or "Completed with Errors."
*   **Errors:** Look for a field or section explicitly labeled **Errors**. This is where the system will often state the problem directly, such as:
    *   *"No files were produced because the 'Native' field was not selected for export."*
    *   *"User does not have 'Export Original' permission."*
    *   *"No native files found for the selected documents."*
*   **Result Text / Logs:** There is often a button to **View Log** or a field that shows a summary of the job's result. Always expand and read this text carefully.

The Job Details page frequently provides the exact reason for the failure without needing deeper investigation.

#### 1. Incorrect "Selected Fields" Setting

**Solution**
1.  In the Export dialog > **Selected Fields** tab.
2.  **Must** include the field that contains the file you want to convert. Usually this is the **Native** field.
3.  Click **Add... > Native** field in the list. Add it to your selected fields.
4.  *Ensure* that the "Extracted Text" field is selected if you want a accompanying text file for each document.
5.  Proceed with export. The system now knows which specific files to process.

#### 2. File Type or Placeholder Issues

**Issue**
Relativity cannot generate TIFFs (color or B&W) from documents that don't have a processable native file.
*   **Placeholder Records:** These are documents that are listed in the database but whose native files were never successfully uploaded or ingested. There's no file to process.
*   **Unsupported File Types:** The system may not be able to convert certain unusual or corrupt file types into an image.

**Solution**
*   Create a view that includes the "Has Native" and "File Type" columns.
*   Run this view for the documents you are trying to export. If "Has Native" is "No," or the "File Type" is blank or problematic, those documents will fail and contribute to a count of zero.

#### 3. Export Permissions

**Issue**
Your user role might have permissions to *see* documents but not to *export* or *print* them (the "Export Original" and "Print" permissions are often controlled separately for security reasons).

**Solution**
*   You will need to contact your Relativity administrator or case manager. Ask them to verify that your user role has the **"Export Original"** and **"Print"** permissions enabled. The "Print" permission is specifically required for generating image exports (like TIFFs).

#### 4. Image Settings Misconfiguration

The export job might be failing during the conversion step itself.

**How to Fix It:**
*   In the Export dialog, on the **Images** tab, ensure your settings are correct:
    *   **Image Format:** `TIFF`
    *   **Color:** `Black and White` (This is the setting that reduces file size).
    *   **Output Options:** `One File per Document` is standard.
    *   **Resolution:** Be reasonable (e.g., 300 DPI). Extremely high resolutions are rarely needed and create huge files, defeating your purpose.
*   Double-check that you haven't set a bizarre Bates number range or prefix that doesn't match any of your selected documents.

### 5. Checklist for TIFF Export

1.  **Select Documents:** In your document list, select the documents to export.
2.  **Open Export Dialog:** Click the **Export** button.
3.  **Export Type:** Choose `Load File Format: Opticon` or `IPRO`. This format generates the TIFFs and a `.dat` load file that maps the images to their metadata.
4.  **Settings Tab:**
    *   **Name:** Give your export a recognizable name.
    *   **Source:** `Current Choice` (or your selected folder/view).
    *   **Data Source:** `Saved Search` or `Current Results Set`.
5.  **Selected Fields Tab (IMPORTANT):**
    *   Click **Add...**.
    *   Find and add the **Native** field.
    *   Find and add the **Extracted Text** field if you want text files.
    *   Click OK.
6.  **Images Tab:**
    *   Select `Yes` for "Produce Images?"
    *   **Type:** `Single-Page`
    *   **Format:** `TIFF`
    *   **Color:** `Black and White`
    *   Set your desired DPI (200-300 is standard).
7.  **Text Tab:**
    *   Select `Yes` for "Export Text?"
    *   **Format:** `Extracted Text` (this pairs the text file with the image).
8.  **Run Export:** Click **Export**. You will be taken to the Jobs tab to monitor progress.

If it still shows "0 files exported" after this, the issue is almost certainly either:
*   **Permissions:** Your user role lacks "Export Original" or "Print" rights. (**Admin Issue**)
*   **Data Integrity:** The selected documents are placeholders with no native file. (Check the "Has Native" column).

### 7. Worst Case Scenario (Server Logs, Admin-Only)

If the Job Details page is vague or doesn't give enough information, the full server logs are needed. These are verbose, machine-generated logs that record every step of the process.

**⚠️ Important:** Access to these logs is typically restricted to **Workspace Administrators** and **Relativity Support**. You will likely need to ask your Relativity admin for help to retrieve and interpret these.

**What an admin would look for in the server logs:**

The admin would find your specific job by its Job ID (from the Jobs tab) and search the logs for that ID. They would look for entries from the `ExportService` or `PrintService` (since image production is a form of printing).

Errors found here could be more detailed, such as:
*   Permission failures from the security subsystem.
*   Errors from the file system when trying to access the native files.
*   Specific errors from the image engine when trying to convert a particular file type.

### Action Plan For You

1.  **Check the Job Details Page First:** Go to the Jobs tab, find your export job, and click on its name. Scour the details for any "Error" message or log text. This is the most likely way you will solve the problem yourself.

2.  **If the Job Details are unclear, contact your Relativity Administrator.** Politely ask them for help and provide them with the **Job ID** and **Job Name**. You can say:

    > "Hi [Admin], I'm trying to run a B&W TIFF export but it's failing with 0 files processed. The Job ID is [12345]. Could you please check the server logs for that job to see if there's a specific permissions error or processing error?"

3.  **Revisit the Checklist:** While you wait, double-check the common issues from our previous message:
    *   **Selected Fields:** Are the **Native** and **Extracted Text** fields definitively selected in the export profile?
    *   **Permissions:** Do you *know* for a fact your role has "Export Original" and "Print" permissions? If not, this is the most likely culprit and what the admin will find.
    *   **Data:** Have you verified via a view that the documents you selected actually have a value of "Yes" in the "Has Native" column?

The logs are the definitive source of truth. Starting with the user-accessible Job Details is your fastest path to an answer.
